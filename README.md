# Surface Water Quality Analysis for Water System Optimization
- Conducted in-depth analysis of surface water quality data to identify trends and patterns crucial for water system operations and management.
- Utilized Python programming and libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- Implemented advanced statistical techniques to extract actionable insights from large datasets, focusing on parameters like “Total Coliform”, “Fecal Coliform”, “E. Coli”, and “Enterococcus”.
- Demonstrated ability to derive meaningful conclusions from complex data, contributing to efforts aimed at improving the efficiency of water distribution systems and enhancing overall water quality.
- Engaged in year-wise and station-wise analysis to understand variations in water quality over time and across different locations, providing valuable insights for decision-making processes.
- Effectively presented the findings to the professor, supporting real-world decisions about water system operations and management.
